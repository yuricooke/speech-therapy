Bilingual and multilingual children should not be assessed with the same tests used for monolingual children. Assessment will be performed through precise analysis of an entire bilingual and multilingual developmental context. Cultural factors such as origin of exposed languages and family aspects will be valued. Situational aspects, such as date of first contact with spoken languages, daily exposure, means of exposure to various languages, dominant language and a complete analysis of how languages are used at school, at home, and in each patient's environment will be extremely important to reach a safer diagnosis of speech and language disorders in each patient.",

          <h2>What is the objective of my bilingual/multilingual therapy?</h2>
          <p>My bilingual and multilingual therapy has as its main objective the welcoming of the patient through their mother tongue. The Therapist & Patient bond is established in a welcoming way when the patient realizes they are understood in what they SPEAK, THINK and FEEL!</p>
          
          <p>Every patient who feels safer and more welcomed consequently presents better motivation, POSITIVELY impacting their therapeutic prognosis. This is undoubtedly the great advantage or the 'Golden Key' of bilingual or multilingual therapy.</p>

          <h2>How is bilingual/multilingual therapy performed?</h2>
          <p>For bilingual and multilingual patients, the languages that will be used during therapy will be determined according to the needs of each patient and their families.</p>
          
          <p>Parents, family members and caregivers will be made aware of therapy programs and methods, as well as rehabilitation objectives, thus being able to support therapy at home. With family cooperation, we can achieve therapy objectives more quickly.</p>

          <h2>How does bilingual/multilingual therapy differ?</h2>
          <p>Bilingual and multilingual therapy differs from common therapies, as it will offer a therapy plan respecting the sociocultural and intercultural aspects of each patient.</p>
          
          <p>In my therapy I will also use international speech-language methods together with my knowledge of clinical psychopedagogy.</p>

          <h2>What is needed for bilingual/multilingual therapy here in Germany?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Valid medical prescription</li>
            <li>Doctor's signature and stamp (not assistants) on the prescription</li>
            <li>The medical prescription must provide data about the diagnosis and session time</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How is speech-language assessment performed in general?</h2>
          <p>The assessment will be performed through standardized tests and observations of all Speech-Language areas (vocabulary, grammar, reading, writing, speech, comprehension and fluency), if possible in all languages/idioms the patient communicates in.</p>
          
          <p>Specific tests to evaluate swallowing and functionality of orofacial organs will also be performed when necessary.</p>

          <h2>How does bilingual/multilingual assessment differ from monolingual assessments?</h2>
          <p>Bilingual or multilingual assessment is a differentiated assessment, as it will mostly not include standardized tests, which can negatively interfere with clinical interpretations of each clinical condition.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Bilingual and multilingual children should not be assessed with the same tests used for monolingual children.</strong></p>

          <p>Assessment will be performed through precise analysis of an entire bilingual and multilingual developmental context. Cultural factors such as origin of exposed languages and family aspects will be valued.</p>

          <h2>Important aspects in assessment</h2>
          <p>Situational aspects will be extremely important to reach a safer diagnosis of speech and language disorders in each patient:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Date of first contact with spoken languages</li>
            <li>Daily exposure to different languages</li>
            <li>Means of exposure to various languages</li>
            <li>Dominant language</li>
            <li>Complete analysis of how languages are used at school, at home, and in each patient's environment</li>

          <h2>Was ist das Ziel meiner zweisprachigen/mehrsprachigen Therapie?</h2>
          <p>Meine zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Therapie hat als Hauptziel die Aufnahme des Patienten durch seine Muttersprache. Die Therapeut-Patient-Bindung wird auf aufnehmende Weise aufgebaut, wenn der Patient merkt, dass er in dem verstanden wird, was er SPRICHT, DENKT und FÜHLT!</p>
          
          <p>Jeder Patient, der sich sicherer und aufgenommener fühlt, zeigt folglich eine bessere Motivation, was sich POSITIV auf seine therapeutische Prognose auswirkt. Dies ist zweifellos der große Vorteil oder der 'Goldene Schlüssel' der zweisprachigen oder mehrsprachigen Therapie.</p>

          <h2>Wie wird die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Therapie durchgeführt?</h2>
          <p>Für zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Patienten werden die Sprachen, die während der Therapie verwendet werden, entsprechend den Bedürfnissen jedes Patienten und seiner Familien bestimmt.</p>
          
          <p>Eltern, Familienmitglieder und Betreuer werden über Therapieprogramme und -methoden sowie Rehabilitationsziele informiert und können so die Therapie zu Hause unterstützen. Mit familiärer Zusammenarbeit können wir Therapieziele schneller erreichen.</p>

          <h2>Wie unterscheidet sich die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Therapie?</h2>
          <p>Die zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Therapie unterscheidet sich von gewöhnlichen Therapien, da sie einen Therapieplan anbietet, der die soziokulturellen und interkulturellen Aspekte jedes Patienten respektiert.</p>
          
          <p>In meiner Therapie werde ich auch internationale Sprach-Sprach-Methoden zusammen mit meinem Wissen über klinische Psychopädagogik verwenden.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Gültige ärztliche Verordnung</li>

          <h2>Wie wird die Sprach-Sprach-Bewertung allgemein durchgeführt?</h2>
          <p>Die Bewertung wird durch standardisierte Tests und Beobachtungen aller Sprach-Sprach-Bereiche (Wortschatz, Grammatik, Lesen, Schreiben, Sprechen, Verständnis und Flüssigkeit) durchgeführt, wenn möglich in allen Sprachen/Idiomen, in denen der Patient kommuniziert.</p>
          
          <p>Spezifische Tests zur Bewertung des Schluckens und der Funktionalität der orofazialen Organe werden ebenfalls bei Bedarf durchgeführt.</p>

          <h2>Wie unterscheidet sich die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Bewertung von einsprachigen Bewertungen?</h2>
          <p>Die zweisprachige oder mehrsprachige Bewertung ist eine differenzierte Bewertung, da sie meistens keine standardisierten Tests enthält, die negativ in die klinischen Interpretationen jedes klinischen Zustands eingreifen können.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Kinder sollten nicht mit denselben Tests bewertet werden, die für einsprachige Kinder verwendet werden.</strong></p>

          <p>Die Bewertung wird durch präzise Analyse eines gesamten zweisprachigen und mehrsprachigen Entwicklungskontexts durchgeführt. Kulturelle Faktoren wie Herkunft der ausgesetzten Sprachen und familiäre Aspekte werden geschätzt.</p>

          <h2>Wichtige Aspekte bei der Bewertung</h2>
          <p>Situative Aspekte werden äußerst wichtig sein, um eine sicherere Diagnose von Sprach- und Sprachstörungen bei jedem Patienten zu erreichen:</p>

Dies ist zweifellos der große Vorteil oder der 'Goldene Schlüssel' der zweisprachigen oder mehrsprachigen Therapie. <br><br> Wie wird die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Therapie durchgeführt?<br><br>Für zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Patienten werden die Sprachen, die während der Therapie verwendet werden, entsprechend den Bedürfnissen jedes Patienten und seiner Familien bestimmt. <br><br>Eltern, Familienmitglieder und Betreuer werden über Therapieprogramme und -methoden sowie Rehabilitationsziele informiert und können so die Therapie zu Hause unterstützen. Mit familiärer Zusammenarbeit können wir Therapieziele schneller erreichen. <br><br>Wie unterscheidet sich die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Therapie?<br><br>Die zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Therapie unterscheidet sich von gewöhnlichen Therapien, da sie einen Therapieplan anbietet, der die soziokulturellen und interkulturellen Aspekte jedes Patienten respektiert. In meiner Therapie werde ich auch internationale Sprach-Sprach-Methoden zusammen mit meinem Wissen über klinische Psychopädagogik verwenden. <br><br>Was wird für die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Therapie hier in Deutschland benötigt?<br><br>• Gültige ärztliche Verordnung;<br>• Unterschrift und Stempel des Arztes (nicht der Assistenten) auf der Verordnung;<br>• Die ärztliche Verordnung muss Daten über die Diagnose und Sitzungszeit enthalten;",

Zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Kinder sollten nicht mit denselben Tests bewertet werden, die für einsprachige Kinder verwendet werden. Die Bewertung wird durch präzise Analyse eines gesamten zweisprachigen und mehrsprachigen Entwicklungskontexts durchgeführt. Kulturelle Faktoren wie Herkunft der ausgesetzten Sprachen und familiäre Aspekte werden geschätzt. Situative Aspekte, wie Datum des ersten Kontakts mit gesprochenen Sprachen, tägliche Exposition, Mittel der Exposition gegenüber verschiedenen Sprachen, dominante Sprache und eine vollständige Analyse, wie Sprachen in der Schule, zu Hause und in der Umgebung jedes Patienten verwendet werden, sind äußerst wichtig, um eine sicherere Diagnose von Sprach- und Sprachstörungen bei jedem Patienten zu erreichen.",

          <h2>Was ist das Ziel meiner zweisprachigen/mehrsprachigen Therapie?</h2>
          <p>Meine zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Therapie hat als Hauptziel die Aufnahme des Patienten durch seine Muttersprache. Die Therapeut-Patient-Bindung wird auf aufnehmende Weise aufgebaut, wenn der Patient merkt, dass er in dem verstanden wird, was er SPRICHT, DENKT und FÜHLT!</p>
          
          <p>Jeder Patient, der sich sicherer und aufgenommener fühlt, zeigt folglich eine bessere Motivation, was sich POSITIV auf seine therapeutische Prognose auswirkt. Dies ist zweifellos der große Vorteil oder der 'Goldene Schlüssel' der zweisprachigen oder mehrsprachigen Therapie.</p>

          <h2>Wie wird die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Therapie durchgeführt?</h2>
          <p>Für zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Patienten werden die Sprachen, die während der Therapie verwendet werden, entsprechend den Bedürfnissen jedes Patienten und seiner Familien bestimmt.</p>
          
          <p>Eltern, Familienmitglieder und Betreuer werden über Therapieprogramme und -methoden sowie Rehabilitationsziele informiert und können so die Therapie zu Hause unterstützen. Mit familiärer Zusammenarbeit können wir Therapieziele schneller erreichen.</p>

          <h2>Wie unterscheidet sich die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Therapie?</h2>
          <p>Die zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Therapie unterscheidet sich von gewöhnlichen Therapien, da sie einen Therapieplan anbietet, der die soziokulturellen und interkulturellen Aspekte jedes Patienten respektiert.</p>
          
          <p>In meiner Therapie werde ich auch internationale Sprach-Sprach-Methoden zusammen mit meinem Wissen über klinische Psychopädagogik verwenden.</p>

          <h2>Was wird für die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Therapie hier in Deutschland benötigt?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Gültige ärztliche Verordnung</li>
            <li>Unterschrift und Stempel des Arztes (nicht der Assistenten) auf der Verordnung</li>

          <h2>Wie wird die Sprach-Sprach-Bewertung allgemein durchgeführt?</h2>
          <p>Die Bewertung wird durch standardisierte Tests und Beobachtungen aller Sprach-Sprach-Bereiche (Wortschatz, Grammatik, Lesen, Schreiben, Sprechen, Verständnis und Flüssigkeit) durchgeführt, wenn möglich in allen Sprachen/Idiomen, in denen der Patient kommuniziert.</p>
          
          <p>Spezifische Tests zur Bewertung des Schluckens und der Funktionalität der orofazialen Organe werden ebenfalls bei Bedarf durchgeführt.</p>

          <h2>Wie unterscheidet sich die zweisprachige/mehrsprachige Bewertung von einsprachigen Bewertungen?</h2>
          <p>Die zweisprachige oder mehrsprachige Bewertung ist eine differenzierte Bewertung, da sie meistens keine standardisierten Tests enthält, die negativ in die klinischen Interpretationen jedes klinischen Zustands eingreifen können.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Zweisprachige und mehrsprachige Kinder sollten nicht mit denselben Tests bewertet werden, die für einsprachige Kinder verwendet werden.</strong></p>

          <p>Die Bewertung wird durch präzise Analyse eines gesamten zweisprachigen und mehrsprachigen Entwicklungskontexts durchgeführt. Kulturelle Faktoren wie Herkunft der ausgesetzten Sprachen und familiäre Aspekte werden geschätzt.</p>

          <h2>Wichtige Aspekte bei der Bewertung</h2>
          <p>Situative Aspekte werden äußerst wichtig sein, um eine sicherere Diagnose von Sprach- und Sprachstörungen bei jedem Patienten zu erreichen:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Datum des ersten Kontakts mit gesprochenen Sprachen</li>
